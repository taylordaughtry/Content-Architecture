# Elements of a Good CMS

### User Roles

Not everybody needs to see every field on every entry.

The ability to create roles per-user allows the system to hide fields that the
current user shouldn't be concerned with. This makes for a very simple, 'clear'
admin screen, which shows a clear objective for each piece of content.

If they can clearly see what content is used where (and how it's used),
it emphasizes to the client WHAT this entry is for, and how it fits into
the overall site architecture.
