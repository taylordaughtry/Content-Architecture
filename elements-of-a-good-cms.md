# Elements of a Good CMS

### User Roles

Not everybody needs to see every field on every entry.

The ability to create roles per-user allows the system to hide fields that the
current user shouldn't be concerned with. This makes for a very simple, 'clear'
admin screen, which shows a clear objective for each piece of content.

If they can clearly see what content is used where (and how it's used),
it emphasizes to the client WHAT this entry is for, and how it fits into
the overall site architecture.

### Content FREEDOM

Avoid any CMS that 'locks you in'. If you can't get all your content *out* of
the CMS, the system is unlikely to be well-structured, and it's just not a good
idea to put the time into the system if you might have to do it again.

(Add a picture of braveheart here when you mention content FREEDOM.)

### Doesn't inject into Back End. If it does, it does it responsibly.

WordPress is notorious for this. You can easily have 30, 40, 50 javascript files
being loaded on your pages. This severely impacts your pageload, which costs you
money.

(Find an example of a CMS that injects tons of crap into the source. Show it.)

### Pages don't end in file extensions (Values the URL structure?)

If you associate the content with this filename, you're tying the content to the
technology. if you change the system, you'll have to change that URL, which has
SEO implications.

### Sensible WYSIWYG

(Show a picture of markup from a WYSIWYG that doesn't make any sense.)

Most WYSIWYGs make for crazy code that can screw up everything. A Good CMS has
a WYSIWYG that actively helps the user keep the code clean, and doesn't allow
anything too ridiculous to pass by.

### Protects the Markup

Treats the markup as a sacred thing. Clean markup = a faster page. Again, we've
seen what happens when the markup isn't treated as sacred.

Refers back to #3 about injecting into backend.)

### Manages Content, NOT the Design

Users, whether it's an Administrator, Author, Editor, whoever, should never be
managing the design. That's what they've just paid thousands of dollars for.

They should be *managing content.*

### Provides Constraints Where Appropriate

As humans, when we're placed in an environment with constraints, it helps us to
concentrate on what's actually important, and helps us create a clearer thought
in our mind.

The same is true in a good CMS: in almost every case, the end-user doesn't need
the entire kitchen sink: they just need the faucet. A good CMS provides a
simple interface that exposes the elements an end-user should be concerned with
changing, and nothing more. When it doubt, leave it out.

Sounds scary to end-users: &lsquo;*But, what if I want to change this, or this,
or this?*&rsquo; You've just paid thousands of dollars for the design and
architecture of the site: trust their work. By pursuing simplicity, a good CMS
provides a clear objective every time you enter content, and avoids choice
paralysis.
