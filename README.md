# Content Architecture

Even with a proper CMS, most developers tend to get stuck in the 'page' mindset.
&ldquo;*This blog entry just needs a title, body, and some tags...*&rdquo; is
something you'll see quite often in the Admin panels of most websites.

Here's the problem: that's not using the 'System' behind the site: what if that
blog post is displayed on various pages of the site with tons of different
needs? (Excerpts, videos, audio files, image sizes â€” the list goes on&hellip;)

## Help your websites COPE

- Most developers tend to use the CMS as an extended 'blog' system: they
	think of content on a 'per-page' basis.
- 'Blog' entry: include a title, body, maybe some tags they're using on
	the page.
- Not taking advantage of the 'Management System': you're still thinking
	page.

## Notes

- Your CMS should be conforming to the site's content.
- COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere
- Allow for Sustainable Content; content that can be created by the client again and again.
- 'Cowboy Coding' extends into using a CMS: no plan for streams, elements, content = a mess
- Content should be related: products related to blog posts, videos related to Products/Blog Posts. Related elements = higher ROI per-element. (Make the content work for the client.)
