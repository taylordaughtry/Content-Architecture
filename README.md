# Content Architecture

Even with a proper CMS, most developers tend to get stuck in the 'page' mindset.
&ldquo;*This blog entry just needs a title, body, and some tags...*&rdquo; is
something you'll see quite often in the Admin panels of most websites.

Here's the problem: that's not using the 'System' behind the site: what if that
blog post is displayed on various pages of the site with tons of different
needs? (Excerpts, videos, audio files, image sizes â€” the list goes on&hellip;)

There's a better approach: help your clients' websites COPE

## Help your websites COPE

- Most developers tend to use the CMS as an extended 'blog' system: they
	think of content on a 'per-page' basis. 
- 'Blog' entry: include a title, body, maybe some tags they're using on
	the page. 
- Not taking advantage of the 'Management System': you're still thinking
	page.

## Notes

- Your CMS should be conforming to the site's content.
- COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere
- Allow for Sustainable Content; content that can be created by the client again and again.
- 'Cowboy Coding' extends into using a CMS: no plan for streams, elements, content = a mess
- Content should be related: products related to blog posts, videos related to Products/Blog Posts. Related elements = higher ROI per-element. (Make the content work for the client.)

**Title Thoughts:**
- Planning for a CMS
- Craft, for example, does it like this:
- Needs to sound somewhat technical
- Content management best practices
- Getting the Most out of Your CMS

**Types of Structures**
- Streams
- Pages
- Singles (Content you'd *never* need two of; like Contact Us)

Not everybody needs to see every field on every entry:
- Add user roles + hide fields that certain types don't need.
- Clear admin = clear objectives
If they can clearly see what content is used where (and how it's used),
it emphasizes to the client WHAT this entry is for, and how it fits into
the overall site architecture.
