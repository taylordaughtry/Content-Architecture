# Content Architecture

Even with a proper CMS, most developers tend to get stuck in the 'page' mindset.
&ldquo;*This blog entry just needs a title, body, and some tags...*&rdquo; is
something you'll see quite often in the Admin panels of most websites.

Here's the problem: that's not using the 'System' behind the site: what if that
blog post is displayed on various pages of the site with tons of different
needs? (Excerpts, videos, audio files, image sizes â€” the list goes on&hellip;)

There's a better approach: help your clients' websites COPE

## Help your websites COPE

- Most developers tend to use the CMS as an extended 'blog' system: they
	think of content on a 'per-page' basis. 
- 'Blog' entry: include a title, body, maybe some tags they're using on
	the page. 
- Not taking advantage of the 'Management System': you're still thinking
	page.

## Description Brainstorming

Websites can be the single most effective tool to connect your organization to your customers. If you're serious about your website, you need a Content Management System. Let's talk about how a CMS can make your life easier when it comes to updating your website, and supercharge your website to connect your company to your users effectively.

Websites can be the single most effective tool to connect your organization to your users. They can also be extremely difficult to manage and update on a consistent basis, so a Content Management System can make your life much easier when it comes to updating your website, and can supercharge your website to connect your company to your users effectively. We'll cover some of the various types of software, but more importantly how to properly organize and architect everything from the file system to the content structure itself.

----

If you've been involved with websites at all in the past few years, you've probably heard of a CMS. Most of us have probably used them before, or are even using one now. What you may not know is that there's a difference between 'putting your content in a CMS', and actually *using it*. So, whether this is your first time really thinking about a CMS, or you've been using one since beta, you'll fit right in. In this talk, we'll cover some of the common types of CMS software you'll encounter, as well as what exactly makes a CMS *effective*.

## Notes

- Your CMS should be conforming to the site's content.
- COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere
- Allow for Sustainable Content; content that can be created by the client again and again.
- 'Cowboy Coding' extends into using a CMS: no plan for streams, elements, content = a mess
- Content should be related: products related to blog posts, videos related to Products/Blog Posts. Related elements = higher ROI per-element. (Make the content work for the client.)

**Title Thoughts:**
- Planning for a CMS
- Craft, for example, does it like this:
- Needs to sound somewhat technical
- Content management best practices
- Getting the Most out of Your CMS

**Types of Structures**
- Streams
- Pages
- Singles (Content you'd *never* need two of; like Contact Us)

Not everybody needs to see every field on every entry:
- Add user roles + hide fields that certain types don't need.
- Clear admin = clear objectives
If they can clearly see what content is used where (and how it's used),
it emphasizes to the client WHAT this entry is for, and how it fits into
the overall site architecture.
